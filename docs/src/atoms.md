## Atoms extraction

Given a `MomentMatrix` with a positive semidefinite moment matrix,
an algebraic system for which the set of solution is a superset of the support of the measure.
If the measure is atomic and the `MomentMatrix` contains enough moments,
the algebraic system will only have a finite number of solutions which are the centers
of the diracs of the measure.

This system is obtained from a low rank cholesky decomposition of the moment matrix.
This decomposition can either be obtained by a cholesky or SVD decomposition from which we remove the rows corresponding to the negligeable eigenvalues/singular values.
